# Learn Ruby

Work through the [Learn to Program Book][learn_to_program] by Chris Pine (use
the free online version) and complete all of the example programs. It is worth
noting that this book was originally written around 2002 and references an older
version of Ruby. No worries though as the current version of Ruby is backwards
compatible and you will be able to use your modern version of Ruby and follow
along with the book.

As you work through the [Learn to Program Book][learn_to_program] please commit
your work to GitHub and ask questions in Campfire if you run into any problems.
