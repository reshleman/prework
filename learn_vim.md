# Learn Vim

Vim is a popular text editor for programming. While it is not required by any
means, we find that once you get over the hurdle of learning it, you will be
much more efficient when using it. If you want to start getting familiar with
it before class starts, we recommend running `vimtutor` from the command line.
It will take about 30 minutes to go through.

Then read [Movin' and Shakin'](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/movin-and-shakin).

Please use Vim to complete assignments in the rest of the prework. Reference the
[Vim Cheatsheet](http://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html) or the [graphical
version](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif) if you forget a command.

As always, hit us up in Campfire if you need assistance with anything.
