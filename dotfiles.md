# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are files who's names begin with a `.` and are used to configure
various programs such as Git, the Terminal shell, and Vim (a text editor you'll
learn about soon). Many developers maintain their own set of dotfiles to
customize the way they interact with these programs, but to keep things simple
you are going to use the dotfiles maintained by the fine folks at thoughtbot.
Once you set them up, your environment will be much easier to use and attractive
to look at.

First, read and follow the instructions for installing thoughtbot's [laptop
script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop). This will install various
programs that you will need for the dotfiles and general Ruby development.

Next, read and follow the instructions for installing thoughtbot's
[dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles). Before cloning (the first
step in the instructions), `cd` into your home directory:

    cd ~
