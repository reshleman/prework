# Typing

You are going to be doing a lot of typing in this class and beyond. We expect
everybody coming into the class to be able to type at least 50 words/minute
without looking at the keyboard. Please [test your typing
speed](http://typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php). If you are below 50 wpm,
practice touch typing with [keybr](http://www.keybr.com/),
[typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/), or
[typing.io](http://typing.io/lesson/ruby/rails/relation.rb/1) until you can type
at least 50 wpm.
