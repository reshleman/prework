# Metis Prework

Congratulations, and welcome to Metis! There is some work to be done before the
first day of class. You’ll need to develop a small web page using HTML and CSS.
The pre-work will provide you with all of the knowledge you’ll need
in order to start building your own web pages. We’ve broken the content of this
packet up into 5 parts, and it is suggested you spend several hours with each
section making sure you fully understand the content. Over the course of the
pre-work we’ll begin what is going to turn into a photo gallery application.
You’ll eventually have a fully-working website with users who can create galleries
and upload images, but to begin we’ll need to create a small page to display some
images. While making this page, please take your time and contact the instructors in
Campfire or via email if you have any questions.

## Typing

You are going to be doing a lot of typing in this class and beyond. We expect
everybody coming into the class to be able to type at least 50 words/minute
without looking at the keyboard. Please [test your typing
speed](http://typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php). If you are below 50 wpm,
practice touch typing with [keybr](http://www.keybr.com/) or
[typing.io](http://typing.io/lesson/ruby/rails/relation.rb/1).

## Project

When you have finished the above tutorials, complete the following project on
your own. Feel free to use the Campfire room to get help from you teachers and
peers.

Create a business card website for yourself. You’ll want to have a paragraph
about yourself as well as a picture and some ways of contacting you either via
email or social network links. Use some CSS in an external file to make the page
look nice. Make sure to validate your website.

Create a git repo for your project and consistently commit and push your code to
GitHub to ensure you do not lose your work.
