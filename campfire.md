# Campfire

We will be using Campfire extensively throughout the class. While you are
welcome to use the web interface, we prefer using native OS X clients to get the
most out of Campfire. Download one of the following and say "hi" to one of us
(or each other) in Campfire. Be sure to [upload an avatar] so it's easy to see
who everyone is.

[Flint] is our favorite. It's $8 in the Mac App store.

[Propane] is free to try, but will prompt you to buy it regularly unless you pay
$20. You can continue using the free version if you don't want to pay.

[Kindling] is an extension for Chrome. If you are not on OS X you should try this.
