## Personal Website

Using what you have learned, you are now going to create a personal website for
yourself. Your website should have a paragraph about yourself as well as a
picture and some ways of contacting you either via email or social network
links. Use some CSS in an external file to make the page look nice. Make sure to
validate your website.

To begin, create a git repository called `username.github.io`, where `username`
is your GitHub username. Consistently commit and push your code to GitHub to
ensure you do not lose your work. When you are done, you'll have a live website
at `username.github.io` that you can share with your friends and family thanks
to [GitHub Pages]! Drop us the link in Campfire when you are done so we can take
a peek.
